# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Application Programming Interface

This project shows the walking route one might use when visiting Brooklyn NY. The route begins at the Botanical Gardens and moves to the Barclay Center, then a local restaurant and finally a hotel. 

## How To Generate Directions

On clicking the button "Brooklyn Afternoon", the user can generate walking directions from the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens to the Barclay Center, the Mediterranean restaurant "OLEA" and The Holiday Inn in Downtown Brooklyn.

### What Comes Next?

Further additions to project could include adding various forms of transportation, like the T or taxi, and one could add other locations which might entail incorporating multiple means of transportation within teh same route (for example, you walk from the Botanical Gardens to the Barclay Center, then take a cab to the harbor, the T to a restaurant and walk from there back to the hotel).
